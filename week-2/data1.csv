Taking a multi-focus approach incorporating attitudes and values, as well as assessments of the operation and performance of institutions, the article addresses levels of trust in Congress."

«As You Deem Best»: Tacit Knowledge and Innovation in the Wood and Furniture District of Brianza.,"Parolin, Laura Lucia; Mattozzi, Alvise",Polis,1,TECHNOLOGICAL innovations; FURNITURE industry; TACIT knowledge,Actor-network theory; industrial district; innovation; network within; tacit knowledge,"The article introduces a case of innovation, that took place in the Brianza wood and furniture industrial district, during the course of interaction between two craftsmen with materials, prototypes, rendering and a product manager from a relevant furniture design company based in the very district. Through a detailed description of these interactions, taking into account their corporal and sensitive features, authors want to show how tacit knowledge is deployed within the interorganisational relations and how this process can lead to innovation. The adoption of an Actor-network theory approach leads authors to consider not how knowledge circulates within a network, but rather how knowledge emerges, reverberates and transforms through the very rearticulating process of the network. It has been possible to show such dynamic thanks to the fact that not only relations among different interorganisational actors, but also the network within certain actors -- the two craftsmen and the pieces on which they worked - have been taken into account."

A meta‐analysis of the indirect impact of foreign direct investment in old and new EU member states: Understanding productivity spillovers.,"Bruno, Randolph Luca; Cipollina, Maria",World Economy,0,META-analysis; FOREIGN investments; EXTERNALITIES (Economics); QUANTITATIVE research; EUROPEAN Union,enlarged Europe; firm performance; foreign direct investment; meta‐regression analysis,"Abstract: In this paper, we summarise, combine and explain recent findings from firm‐level empirical literature focusing on the indirect impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic performance, measured as productivity, in the Enlarged Europe. We have reviewed 52 quantitative studies, released between 2000 and 2015 and codified 1,133 estimates. We run a regression of regressions which measures the strength of the FDI–productivity relationship. Taking advantage of large number of high‐quality studies on FDI and its role in explaining the growth in firms’ productivity in Europe, we adopt recent meta‐regression analysis methods<italic>—funnel asymmetry and precision estimate tests</italic> and <italic>precision‐effect estimate with standard errors</italic>—to explain the heterogeneous impact of FDI. This paper assesses the country‐specific impact of FDI on firms’ performance, after taking publication selection bias, econometric modelling and the individual studies’ characteristics fully into account. Our results show that on average FDI has a positive indirect impact on productivity. The impact is especially significant in selected European countries, and we interpret this as a sign of better absorptive capacities in those countries."

A New Authority Emerging out of Harmonization Needs: Is BEREC the right solution for European eCommunications Market?,"BEYDOĞAN, Turgut Ayhan",Review of International Law & Politics,0,TELECOMMUNICATION policy; EUROPEAN Community; TELECOMMUNICATION -- Europe,2002 Regulatory Framework; BEREC; eCommunications; EU commission; harmonization,"Since the establishment of the European Community, creating an effective eCommunications single market has been a matter of highest political priority. As a result of certain technological development and enhanced competition as well as keeping with the principle of 'better regulation needs, the EU Commission has reviewed 2002 Regulatory Framework which preliminarily aimed at shedding light on a number of important problems that remain to be solved, in particular the lack of consistency in the application of EU rules and the regulatory fragmentation of the internal market. However, due to several reasons, the European Union (EU) has not become so successful in constituting such a harmonized eCommunications market mainly stemming from different applications applied in different member states. To overcome these obstacles, the Commission is therefore, in the end decided to establish a new Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) which has the responsibility to work in close cooperation with National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs) and the Commission. U is understood that the Authority has an advisory role vis-à-vis the Commission as regards market regulation issues and could issue non-binding guidelines, recommendations and binding decisions in specific circumstances to promote and disseminate good practices among the NRAs, However, there are also some hesitations about the power of BEREC and its capability with regard to ensure consistency of NRAs' approaches and/or implementations. In this paper, it is discussed as to whether the creation of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) is the right solution for the intended results of a harmonized eCommunications market and elimination of inconsistency in the application of EU rules."
A Theoretical Explanation on Historical Experience and the Vision of Future of Building up the Ruling Party in China.,Tang Huangfeng,Wuhan Daxue Xuebao (Zhexue Shehui Kexue Ban)/Wuhan University Journal (Philosophy & Social Sciences),1,NATION building; CHINESE Communist Party; CHINA -- Politics & government,building up the ruling party; openness and inclusiveness; the capacity of political leadership; the experience of China's political transformation; Transforming Party,"The Chinese Communist Party (CPC) as the key agent of state-building and political development, the experience and tendency of its own transition and development is of great significance to rationally scrutinize the process of political transformation in China. Since the reform and opening up, the development of the market economy had extensively and intensively changed China's political environment. Moreover, profound changes in internal and external governance environment had promoted rationalization and modernization of the CPC itself. In response to the social demand and in order to solve social problems effectively, the ruling party had incrementally achieved modern transformation. To enhance the ruling party's adaptability gradually through political openness is the basic historical experience to build up a transforming party in power. Reconstructing the transforming party, promoting its openness and inclusiveness, improving its responsiveness and adaptability, enhancing the capacity of political leadership in order to control the reforming tides, then guiding and leading modern transformation of Chinese state through modern transformation of the ruling party, all are the visions of future on building up the ruling party in China."

ABD'nin Afganistan Politikasının Açmazları: Bölgesel Bir Analiz.,"ÖNAL, Hilal",Review of International Law & Politics,0,,ABD Diş Politikası; Afganistan; Pakistan; Taliban; terörizm,"Bilindiği gibi, 11 Eylül saldırıları sonucunda ABD’nin ilk hedefi, terörizme destek verdiği iddia edilen Afganistan’daki Taliban yönetimi olmustur. ABD, Afganistan odaklı bölgesel çıkarlarını hayata geçirmeye ve bu doğrultuda 2001 yılından beri bölgede süregelen istikrarsızlığı ortadan kaldırmaya çalısmaktadır. Ancak, bu bölgeye iliskin ABD’nin asması gereken birçok engel bulunmaktadır. Öncelikle, Taliban Afganistan’ın büyük bölümünde kontrolü elinde tutmakta ve Pakistan’daki etkisini de artırmaktadır. Ayrıca, ABD’nin Afganistan’a yerleserek ulasmaya çalıstığı stratejik ve ekonomik hedefleri, bölgesel rakipleri olan Rusya ve Çin ile çatısmaktadır. Bu bağlamda, tüm bu çatısan çıkarları ve Afganistan’daki dengeleri etkileme potansiyelleri ile İran ve Pakistan’ın ön plana çıktığını belirtmek gerekmektedir. Bölgede değisen ve çatısan ulusal çıkar kapsamlı politikalar, ABD’nin Afganistan’da Taliban ile mücadelesini de olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Bu çalısmada, belirttiğimiz hususların veya olumsuzlukların ABD’yi bölgede basarısız kılabileceği savunulmaktadır."

In doing so, the author uses a model of an analogy between the structure of the state and the structure of the international community. In his analysis, he focuses on those actors which participate in global governance and best fit the so-called ""domestic analogy"": international governmental and non-governmental organisations, and international parliamentary institutions. He argues that, as the nature of problems which an individual faces becomes more global, decision-making processes will increasingly also take place at the global level. The more global governance becomes ""government"" the more pressure by non-state actors to participate in these processes will mount. In such an environment, traditional diplomacy is becoming a means of communication used not only by states but also by other actors."

AN OUTLINE OF SLOVENIAN DIPLOMACY OR THE DIPLOMACY OF SLOVENIANS.,"Rahten, Andrej",Teorija in Praksa,1,"INTERNATIONAL relations; SLOVENIA; HABSBURG, House of",diplomacy; Habsburg monarchy; history; Paris Peace Conference; Yugoslavia,"The article deals with the history of Slovenian diplomacy, which - according to the author - should not be confined to the existence of an independent Slovenian nation-state only. In addition to many prominent personalities in internal politics, Slovenians could also be found in the diplomatic services of the Habsburg Monarchy as well as the monarchic and socialist Yugoslavia. Among diplomats of Slovenian origin serving under Habsburg Emperors, the following should be mentioned: Alojz Dobravec, Chevalier de Saldapenna, Anton Lavrin, Baron Josef Schwegel, and Alojz Pogačar. During the Yugoslav Kingdom, Izidor Cankar served as an Envoy to Argentina, Canada and Greece. Between the two world wars, three Slovenians served as Envoys to Prague: Ivan Hribar, Albert Kramer and Bogumil Vošnjak. The former Prime Minister of the Provincial Government for Slovenia, Leonid Pitamic, even became an Envoy to Washington. Several Slovenians could also be found within the League of Nations. Ivan Perne was head of the League of Nations Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As for those working in the administration of the League of Nations, the highest position was taken by Vladimir Miselj, who worked in the Secretariat. After the Second World War, the leading Slovenian communist Edvard Kardelj even played - apart from Josip Broz Tito - a key role in the foreign policy of Socialist Yugoslavia. In the 1970s, the number of Slovenians in Yugoslav diplomacy began to fall, especially at the lower diplomatic levels. During the break-up of the Yugoslav state, the majority of Slovenian diplomats supported the efforts of Slovenia's political leadership to achieve independence and take an active part in struggling for international recognition."

ANALYSIS OF THE PROLONGED CO-RESIDENCE OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN SLOVENIA.,"KUHAR, Metka",Teorija in Praksa,1,PARENT & adult child; ADULT children living with parents,extended co-residence; housing; parents; young people,"After initially presenting the phenomenon of the prolonged co-residence of parents and young adult children in Slovenia, two subsamples of 19- to 29-year-olds who are no longer at school are compared - those still living in the household of their parents or carers and those who have already moved out. The potential factors affecting the timing of leaving the parental home are checked: demographic, social and economic; factors associated with the status transitions from youth to adulthood and family-relationships factors. Both sub-samples are derived from a representative survey on a sample of 15- to 29-year-old Slovenians called Youth 2010. The analysis highlights the very close relationship between the timing of one's departure from the home of origin with the decision to create a family, noting that economic independence also significantly influences this status passage."

Yet, in recent years, the n specific role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in political transformation processes receives more scholarly attention, especially against the background of its dissemination and further (technical) developments. Hence, this paper focuses on the concrete structural and functional innovations achieved by New Media (i.e. social media and microblogs) and develops the concept of three dilemmas each authoritarian regime encounters in a different way. This paper poses the central question what potential New Media embodies during different phases of political change. It focuses on the Arab Spring with a case study on Egypt. Based on empirical data derived from comprehensive field work, a micro study will categorize the role of New Media during the different phases of political upheaval in Egypt since 2011 ."

"Autocracies, Democracies, and the Legitimacy of International Organizations.",,Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,LEGITIMACY of governments; INTERNATIONAL agencies -- Legitimacy,convergence; legitimacy; legitimation; regime type; united nations general assembly,"This article addresses a central gap within empirical legitimacy research, which results from the systematic negligence of non-democratic regimes and their evaluations of international institutions. In particular, it seeks to clarify divergent theoretical assumptions on the influence of the regime type on patterns of (de-)legitimation of global governance. Do states externalize legitimacy standards in line with their own domestic practices of legitimation? Or is their international legitimacy discourse part of a process of global convergence? This article uses qualitative content analysis to compare the legitimacy standards democratic, autocratic and hybrid regimes refer to in their assessments of the United Nations General Assembly. The empirical results reveal a surprisingly high consistency among the three regime types' legitimacy judgments. The study thereby provides empirical evidence against the transfer thesis and in support of the assumption of a global convergence in the patterns of legitimation of global governance."
AUTONOMISM AND EGALITARIANISM THE SLOVENIAN WAY: BETWEEN (PRE)MODERNITY AND (POST)COLONIALISM.,"TOPLAK, Cirila",Teorija in Praksa,1,EQUALITY; SLOVENIA; AUTONOMISM,autonomism; egalitarianism; nature religion of Posočje; political history; self-management,"This article is based on the premise that co-management and self-organising principles are 'autochthonous' political traditions, i.e. typical historical forms of social organisation in Slovenian-speaking lands. Subsequently, autonomism and egalitarianism may be regarded as typical ideological backgrounds of Slovenian political culture. The author verifies this thesis by applying the micro-historical method as well as certain theories from the field of post-colonial studies, in particular to seek to identify the primordial form of Slovenian social organisation by a perspectivist translation of cultural differences, and to subsequently assess Slovenian society's capacity to conserve and reflect on its authentic political traditions. With this aim in mind, a case study of the local history of political organising in northwestern Slovenia is explained, where the retrospectively registered oral tradition is confronted with the ""exterior"" view by local written sources on the same topic. In response to the initial research questions, the author concludes that it is necessary to conceptually differentiate between traditional local autonomisms and the nationalist idea of autonomism produced by the modern imagined national community, and that the Slovenian concept of egalitarianism has always been restrained by patriarchy. Nevertheless, the era of Yugoslav socialist self-management is seen as being the greatest rapprochement between the primordial and state forms of social organisation and thereby the period of the greatest capacity of Slovenian society to think itself autonomously, as shown by the quality of social criticism produced by Yugoslav theoreticians at the time."

"Between Internationalisation, Nationalisation and Europeanisation.",,Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,INTERNATIONAL relations -- Periodicals; EUROPEANIZATION; GERMAN periodicals,european discourse; german ir; ir discourse; security studies; zib,The article examines the last ten years of ZIB with an emphasis on security publications in German and international contexts. The article argues that ZIB is marked by an ambivalence of internationalisation and non-intemationalisation which helps to strengthen but does not fully exhaust its potential to support professionalism in German IR. This can be seen in the significant lack of variety in themes and methodologies but also in the danger of renationalising German IR. Whether ZIB wants to proactively address these problems and dangers with a stronger embeddedness in distinctly European discourses and a future publication in English is something the German IR community can only decide for itself.
Beyond euroscepticism and europhilia: Multiple views about Europe.,"Russo, Federico; Cotta, Maurizio",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,EUROSCEPTICISM; POLITICAL attitudes; EUROPEAN Union countries,Crisis; Elite; Europe; European Integration; Parliaments,"The purpose of this paper is to map the structure of preferences concerning the European Union held by parliamentarians of the member states. The opinions of national politicians are relevant as they influence the governments which participate in the institutions and the decision making processes of the Union. Do they evaluate the European integration process according to a single independence-integration dimension? Or do they acknowledge the existence of multiple lines of conflict? Is the structure of preferences stable? Finally, how are national parliamentarians grouped according to their preferences and what this can tell about the future of European Integration? This paper, based on a two waves survey of national parliamentarians belonging to 16 member states, analyses their views about the governance system and the policy goals of the EU. The findings of this paper shed some new light on several old questions. Firstly, while several studies assume that the preferences about European Integration can be ordered in a one-dimensional continuum that has the status quo and complete integration as the two opposite poles, this paper shows that the preferences of national parliamentarians have a multi-dimensional structure. Secondly it moves to analyse the four main clusters of national parliamentarians which these preferences generate. And thirdly it discusses how these clusters react to different problems and challenges the EU faces today."

The approach to the sociotechnical network which aligns forensic science with state governance policies, criminal investigation practices and laws, and the cultural imaginaries surrounding DNA and criminal investigation work is based on the concepts of biolegality and the forensic imaginary, which are, in turn, anchored in notions of biocitizenship and bioidentification, respectively. An interpretative and qualitative theoretical-methodological perspective has been adopted, based on the analysis of legislation and of the meanings and relevance attributed to the use of DNA technology by elements of the Criminal Police. The objective is to discuss aspects of the local tensions created by processes involving the export of DNA technology, which has its origins in societies and cultures with different traditions of technology governance, of regulation of criminal investigation procedures and of submission of evidence in court."

Relatively rapid and notable integration steps have taken place in response to the crisis in order to address among others vulnerabilities in the banking system and in the public finances of EU member states. In some cases, the need for action was particularly urgent as member states became entrenched in a vicious sovereign-bank nexus endangering financial stability in EMU. In the area of financial supervision in particular, national authorities within an incomplete European framework proved ill equipped to respond to the evolving crisis. The initial remedial action taken was later supplemented by deeper institutional reforms leading to an increased level of integration. This paper provides an explanation of these developments from a neo-functionalist perspective, and identifies in particular the concept of functional spillover as a driver in this process. The crisis amplified functional spillovers between the different policy areas under EMU. It provided the trigger for the manifestation of underlying functional pressures leading to deeper integration. We conclude that until such functional pressures adequately subside, this process can be expected to yield further integration steps."

Frankfurt; Martin Heidegger; temporality,"There is a striking similarity between the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and Harry G. Frankfurt: they both argue that the temporal nature of human existence and agency is due to the fact that humans care about things. Even though Heidegger's concept of care and Frankfurt's concept of caring are very different, they are worth comparing because they play a similar role and have similar significance in their thinking. This comparison also offers an opportunity for a desired dialogue between philosophers working in those two different traditions. I argue that the two views can complement each other: Though Frankfurt provides a detailed psychological description of caring, his concept of caring is too mentalistic and leads to solipsism. Thus, his theory can be enriched with the help of Heidegger's view based on the concept of Being-in-the-world."

"China's exports, export tax rebates and exchange rate policy.","Xu, Zhenhui",World Economy,0,EXPORTS; EXPORT duties; TAX rebates; FOREIGN exchange rates -- Government policy; FOREIGN exchange rates; CHINA,China; exchange rates; export tax rebates; exports; external imbalance,"Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between China's exports, export tax rebates and exchange rate policy. It offers an explanation for why China's exports continued to rise under RMB real appreciations during the Asian financial crisis. Based on a traditional export demand model, we test our hypothesis that the counteracting effects of China's export tax rebate policy have diminished the effectiveness of real exchange rates in facilitating the resolution of trade imbalances under the current pegged exchange rate regime. We find evidence that RMB real appreciations during the crisis negatively affected China's exports, but the negative effects were mitigated by the positive effects of export tax rebates. We also find evidence of a long‐run relationship between China's exports and the other explanatory variables. The empirical evidence suggests that under the pegged exchange rate regime with limited adjustments, real exchange rate movements alone cannot resolve China's external imbalances. The policy implication of this study is that China needs to redirect its decades‐long export‐oriented development strategy to one that emphasises domestic demand‐oriented development and to replace the current pegged exchange rate regime with a market‐oriented more flexible exchange rate regime."

Cité créative et cité durable ?

In this sense, cultural policies have taken a local, entrepreneurial turn, which has been described as the creative city. However, there have been growing calls for new paradigms in which culture can contribute towards a more sustainable form of development. Within this context, Barcelona has developed a cultural policy model which has been presented as a balanced synthesis of the models for the creative and the sustainable city. Local government has therefore played a leading role in the movement for sustainable and participatory cultural policies for cities. However, some of the measures associated with the planning of cultural facilities, participation in culture and the organisation of big events indicate that the strategy that has been adopted faces contradictions and limitations regarding the involvement of the artistic and local community."

The journal's success is due to interventions in global debates. The argument is twofold: First, visibility of a specific topic is established through ZIB debates. Second, this topic is introduced to the global IR community based on English language publications. This strategy leads beyond quantitative expansion. It includes a qualitative advance through access to contestation in two connected discursive spaces, i.e. the German speaking context and English speaking global context. ZIB's most important role is therefore that of facilitating space and access to contestation within and beyond the German IR community. As this article shows, the connection between the ZIB debates with the global community provides the opportunity for successful intervention in global debates. The article develops this argument with reference to three central debates in German IR."
Continuation-Change Contest in Foreign Policy.,"SÜMER, Gültekin",Review of International Law & Politics,0,INTERNATIONAL relations; CHANGE; WORLD politics,change; continuation; foreign policy; great power; international system,"One of the basic characteristics observed in the foreign policy of a state is the contest between continuation and change. Continuation earns foreign policy of a state an identity while keeping it between certain parameters, just when continuation cannot respond to the basic requirements of a state's foreign policy due to internal and external causes, change becomes a necessity in foreign policy. A state faces change in foreign policy as inevitability and a choice as well. Change takes on inevitability depending on how strong the internal and external dynamics compel a state to pursue a new course in foreign policy."

CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATION'S POLITICISATION IN SLOVENIA.,"ČEHOVIN, Marko; HAČEK, Miro",Teorija in Praksa,1,PUBLIC administration; CIVIL service,civil service; formal and material politicisation; politicians; politicisation; public administration; state administration,"Even though some level of politicisation is pressed into the »genetic material« of administrative system, the majority of experts agree that a system with high levels of politicisation is less efficient because a large share of individuals do not have the chance to develop to their full potential. The negativity of politicisation is even more devastating in smaller states like Slovenia since those states have a limited set of human resources available. On the basis of a detailed analysis of the state administration' politicisation in Slovenia, the authors can confirm that the level of politicisation is quite high; after the country's accession to the European Union (2004) and adoption of so-called saving laws (2010-2013) this politicisation trend is even strengthening. Despite the formal existence of mechanisms of a meritocratic state administration system, politicians play an increasingly decisive role in the employment and advancement of civil servants, and are in total control of the appointment and dismissal of high-ranking civil servants. The predominance of politicians in their relationship towards civil servants can be changed via relatively simple changes to formal normative acts and so the authors also propose seven priority proposals to bring about less politicisation."

However, neither the president system nor the responsibility cabinet system could have made the state regime function normally. On the contrary, the form of government was always a cause of the civil war for the legally constituted authority. From the perspective of the legal culture, the view on centralization of the state power had to be an important factor for the restructure of the system of government. With the cultural analysis of the theory on the form of government based on the view on centralization of the state power, the traditional legal culture started the process of the cultural restructure of the system of government."

One side of the debate suggests by enumerating the compelling factors, that the current global attitude and positioning of the EU should not be changed much; the 'Normative Power Europe' model should continue. The opposite side suggests that the EU must transform itself to a global (hard) power; the world outside of the EU still has a realist order. The EU should stop overlooking the realist world in order to defend its interests and to globally protect its normative order which were created within, in the long run. According to those who defend the normative model, for the EU, trying to protect its interests and to stabilize its neighborhood by using military might mean nothing but betrayal to its founding philosophy. Therefore, the EU should try to continue the relatively normative order within and should try to spread it globally. Undoubtedly, the result of the debate, between these Kantian and Hobbesian EU visions, will concern Turkey too."

One of the principal characteristics of this challenge was the electoral recovery of the PRI, which seemed certain to win, representing for some a return to authoritarian rule. The essay considers this possibility in the light of analysis of the institutional maturity of political changes (electoral, in competency and participation, relations between branches of power and between the federation and the states), and concludes that such a return to the past is unlikely. However, this conclusion does not mean that democracy is becoming entrenched, given the resistance offered by numerous informal practices such as clientelism, corporatism, corruption and the lack of effective rule of law."

Starting from a theoretical framework drawing on both consumer studies and Science and technology studies (Sts), in its first part the article sets some of the main phenomena related to the digitalisation of consumption in a wide perspective. Then, it considers the trajectories of digitalisation in the fields of music, magazines and books, pointing out the peculiarities of the Italian context and the differences with the United States. In the last part, the article discusses the implications of digitalisation on the experiences and the symbolic processes related to cultural consumption, considering two main issues: the evolution and the role of the «infrastructures of digital consumption» and the reconfiguration of the role of materiality of cultural contents in consumers' experience. In the end the artide draws attention to the need to renew and extend theoretical tools to study cultural consumption in the age of digital media."

On the basis of an evaluation of the changing international environment, the evolution of IB and economic diplomacy we establish that there are more convergences than differences between ED and IB, and that there is more complementarity than substitution. In spite of the blurring differences between the two complementary spheres, the needed priorities and competencies have a different weight in each case. The role of ED of shifting economic centres to Asia is substantially increasing and so are the soft competencies needed to master the cross-cultural differences. Hence, economic diplomats must become more managerial and IB managers more diplomatic in order to cope with the unpredictability and increasing risks in the world and IB. A different array of necessary competencies must also become important when selecting economic diplomats."

This trend has provoked a heated debate between sociologists, political scientists and legal scholars. Since publication, Max Weber's famous discussion of antiformal tendencies in modern law, in Economy and Society, has defined the terms of the debate over welfare state law. In response to the problems resulting from the law's materialization, G. Teubner proposes a reflexive law model. J. Habermas offers his proceduralist paradigm of law and hopes it will satisfactorially answer the debates between the liberal, social-welfare and reflexive models. This paper hopes to show that Habermas's paradigm proves to be a creative force while raising some questions."
Do WTO+ commitments in services trade agreements reflect a quest for optimal regulatory convergence?

We bridge this gap using a sample of 15 South/South‐East Asian countries, given the burgeoning trend of Asian economies towards services preferentialism and the largely WTO+ nature of their preferential services commitments. Our empirical findings suggest that Asian trading dyads with regulatory frameworks that are more similar and more trade restrictive tend to undertake higher levels of WTO+ commitments in their STAs. There is also evidence in our results, including by modes of supply, for WTO+ commitments in Asian STAs being driven by goods trade complementarities, alluding to supply chain dynamics in the region. Such results support the hypothesis that the heightened “servicification” of production generates a demand to lower services input costs arising from regulatory incidence and heterogeneity."

On the level of ideology, capitalism reflected itself mostly through the Reformation. Modern ideologies developed in the Enlightenment and obtained their clear form in the French Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, three main ideologies prevailed and were organised in three main parties: the conservative Catholic Slovenian People’s Party, the socialist social democracy and the liberal (national) party. Yet the strongest impact on the Slovenian political arena came from the struggle for national autonomy and gaining political support to create the administrative framework for unifying the entire Slovenian nation. Compared to other European nations where the citizenry represented the major force in creating national independence, the Slovenian citizenry was too weak to put on the agenda for that. Because no political force among Slovenians was strong enough, political ideologies also became underdeveloped and were more subdivisions of corporatism: conservatism, liberalism, socialism and nationalism. Corporate nationalism was a common denominator of all three."

We employ a gravity framework on a country‐industry‐year‐level panel data set that matches EXIM authorisations with US bilateral exports. Our results depict the general ineffectiveness of the Bank in promoting exports within and across industries. Some heterogeneities behind the general finding are also uncovered: industries other than aerospace parts and products are more likely to benefit from EXIM authorisations, and EXIM authorisations to larger businesses seem to be more effective in encouraging exports. Furthermore, we find no evidence that EXIM encourages US exports by offsetting foreign ECA competition. These results are neither affected by competing countries’ membership to the OECD Arrangement nor by the size of American firms that received EXIM support. Our results cast doubt on the ubiquitously positive claims made by the Bank and its supporters, yet also provide policy lessons for countries that are either in the inception stages of establishing their own ECAs or are now placing greater importance on ECA financing in encouraging exports."

It argues in four historical sketches that resistance and »liberation« have not led to less rule but rather to its intensification. This is shown for the early modem state in Europe, for forms of colonial domination, for the era of organized capitalism and for forms of domination in postcolonial states. The expansion of government and its contradictions become visible by going beyond the institutionalistic perspective, encompassing social carriers and changing forms of subjectivity."

By analysing the propaganda of the Flemish Nieuw-Vlaams Alliantie and the Northern Italian Lega Nord, it argues that: first, moments of crisis can not only be an occasion of contestation, but also of defence of the existing order (in this case the austerity measures imposed by the European Commission); second, although the current discourse hegemonic at the European level, in which northern productive countries are often opposed to southern lazy ones, matches these parties' description of their own domestic situation, they show diverging opinions concerning the crisis and the ways to solve it. This, we argue, is due to both long-term reasons (relating to Italy's supposed modernity deficit) and short-term ones (the different impact of austerity measures in the two countries). Both parties' discourses are, however, characterised by a strong moral dimension linking their regions' economic success to their people's moral excellence."

The changing relationship between governments and multinational enterprises reveals increasing co-operation and development of services. In contrast, a survey-based analysis of major barriers in international business and an evaluation of institutional support highlight the rise in demand. The conceptual framework suggests that greater and earlier co-operation, the increased quality of analytics, exchanges of experience, learning and developing skills and adjusting expectations could bridge this supply-demand gap."

The results suggest that relative to East Asia, Latin American labour markets are somewhat more integrated, but considerable differences across countries persist. In addition, the evidence indicates that the degree of labour market integration across Latin American borders is significantly less than that of labour markets within the United States in two of the three indicators. These differences may suggest opportunities for efficiency gains from further labour market integration."

El reparto inequitativo de la renta del ferrocarril entre Bogotá y Panamá, el fracaso en la construcción del canal interoceánico, la Guerra de los Mil Días que ganaron los conservadores, y la negación del tratado Herrán-Hay se conjugaron para que las élites panameñas abandonaran a Colombia."

Although significant progress has been made over the last 15 years, daily news reports of corruption and police inefficiency suggest that the improvements have not gone far enough. This article reflects on the failure of the reforms and their backers to produce more professional policing bodies, through a comparative analysis of the reforms implemented in four Mexican municipalities. The causes of this failure point to a combination of formal and informal rules that create incentives that impede the development of a merit-based promotion system, the institutionalization of initiatives for municipal police reform and horizontal accountability."

Our analysis is based on a survey of all research organisations in Slovenia that was conducted at the end of 2009 and start of 2010. Young researchers represent 35-36% of total emigration among researchers and one-third of the total employment mobility of researchers within the country. The characteristics of a typical emigrant among young researchers are: a man, a doctor of science, from natural and technical sciences, and 32 years of age. The paper also presents the views of general managers of research organisations about both programmes of young researchers, the emigration of these researchers and their employment prospects within Slovenia."

Epistemic Communities and Transnational Governance.,"Schneiker, Andrea",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,HUMANITARIANISM; NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; SOCIETIES; EPISTEMICS,epistemic communities; humanitarian non-governmental organisations; identity; networks; security,"Since a few years, humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are faced with increased insecurity in some of the regions in which they work. Given that humanitarians traditionally consider themselves to be protected by their neutrality, assuming that assisting those in need will automatically ensure acceptance of their work by the local population and the conflicting parties, the increased insecurity challenges the identity of humanitarian NGOs. Hence, addressing this insecurity proves challenging for NGOs, which is why they tend to shy away from taking steps in this direction. Nevertheless, many humanitarian NGOs are changing their attitudes towards security issues and have, for example, established an internal security management and exchange security-relevant information among each other. An analysis based on 27 semi-structured interviews reveals that this development can be explained by the activities of an epistemic community of humanitarian security experts. The latter is neither primarily nor exclusively composed of scientists, but of individuals coming from different sectors who share a professional expertise, on the one hand, and a particular set of values, on the other. Those two elements explain not only the internal cohesion of the epistemic community, but also why the standards it formulates are accepted by other non-state and even by governmental actors and, hence, why the epistemic community can be considered to dispose of authority."

Failed Securitization or Changing Security Conceptions: Is the Copenhagen School Helpful when Analyzing Climate Change?,"Oels, Angela; von Lucke, Franziskus",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,WORLD politics; DEPOLITICIZATION; CLIMATE change,climate change; Copenhagen School; environmental security; securitization; United Nations,"Over the last decade, climate change has increasingly been discussed as a security threat. In this essay, we ask from the perspective of the Copenhagen School, if climate change has been successfully »securitized«. We show that there were many speech acts in the realm of international politics which problematized climate change as a security issue but that hardly anyone adopted extraordinary measures to address it. However, this failed securitization does not mean that climate security discourse did not have any policy implications. We use the case of climate change in order to illustrate some well-known weaknesses of the original Copenhagen School's theory of securitization and demonstrate the added value of theory extensions for our case. From an extended theoretical perspective, we show that climate security discourse presents dangerous levels of climate change as an unchangeable matter of fact. It thereby renders invisible the scope for fighting climate change. Instead, resilience to climate change impacts comes to the foreground. We argue that this is a problematic form of de-politicization as well."

This continuity may be explained by the pressure exerted ""from outside"" on the Mexican government by international human rights groups, and by the effect of applying an external ""lock-in"" on new foreign policy on the issue. This policy has had little impact on respect for human rights in Mexico. The foreign policy of openness and multilateral activism has been a significant aspect of a process (one that is incomplete and contentious) of redefining the identity of Mexico in the international sphere."

From democracy to capitalism: The war over the liberal peace.,"Castelli, Emanuele; Ghatagnier, J. Tyson",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,DEMOCRACY; CAPITALISM; LIBERALISM,Capitalism; Democracy; Liberalism; Peace; War,"Recent studies have noted that warfare has declined markedly in recent years. This reduction in global conflict has prompted a curious wave of in-fighting within the liberal school of international relations, where scholars are debating the causes of this new peace. While democratic peace theory enjoyed a general consensus during the 1980s and 1990s, some have recently suggested that the attenuation of violence is attributable to the spread of capitalism. This debate has important policy implications, as it could suggest whether fostering economic growth or democracy would be most constructive in promoting peace. Drawing from recent contributions to this discussion, we reconstruct the story of the broader liberal peace, tracing the substantive results obtained over the past three decades, highlighting the problems plaguing each type of peace (Kantian, democratic, commercial, and capitalist), and addressing the questions that remain open in the field."
From disapproval to change?

But the Russian political system is complicated, and even the ruling force consists of many elements: government, the ruling 'United Russia' party, Parliament, regional governors, and so forth. There are strong and growing signs that the Russian population is deeply unhappy with the current situation, and that discontent has a chance to spill over into the territory of political consequences. Despite the fact that Putin's overall hold on the country remains largely unchallenged, authorities run a very serious risk of showing weak results at the upcoming Parliamentary elections in September 2016."

Recent analyses suggest that changes in the last decade in many European countries, including Slovenia went in the opposite direction - fewer workers have the perspective of flexicurity, while for most, and especially the youth working lives are characterized by an increasing precariousness. This article has two purposes: to contribute to the current conceptual debate on the flexibility and precarity and to contribute to the understanding of the observed changes at the labour market in Slovenia."

As an alternative, the authors propose a critical research program on international norms based on a post-structuralist perspective. This perspective should allow researchers to unmask hegemonic norms and values, to reconstruct and strengthen non-Western, local norms and values and to become aware and reflective of their position in truth production. We demonstrate that this proposal fails to enable a critical research program because (1) it misjudges the strengths and weaknesses of constructivist norm research, (2) it furthers a non-reflective application of concepts such as »western« and »local«, and (3), it develops no intellectual tools to normatively judge political processes."

Germany and the Juncker Plan IN FOCUS: three steps to reconcile fiscal consolidation and investment.,"Drea, Eoin; Conry, Simon",European View,1,"ECONOMIC policy; INVESTMENTS; JUNCKER, Jean-Claude, 1954-",,"Unsurprisingly even within the 'Brussels bubble' economists cannot agree on the ultimate result of President Juncker's European Fund for Strategic Investments (Juncker Plan). The mobilisation of additional funding mechanisms-over and above agreed national and EU frameworks-has caused unease with those who have prioritised budgetary consolidation as an immediate policy imperative. However, this note highlights that fiscal balance and increased investment are not mutually exclusive political actions, but rather form important elements of a sustainable economic policy framework."

This article examines the relationship of global crises and local conflicts using protests against the high cost of living in Burkina Faso as an example. Burkina Faso was among the states that witnessed particularly intense confrontations related to the global food price crisis of 2007/2008. How are global crises mediated so that they lead to conflicts and collective action at the national and local level? This question is dealt with referring to the analytical concepts of scale and framing. Global crises result in political protest, when oppositional actors successfully frame them in a way that links them to existing conflicts and claims, thus mobilizing protest potentials."

Such fresh approaches are needed in new democratic countries like Slovenia where a number of internal and external factors determine the formation, duration and collapse of cabinets. In addition to the electoral threshold, the insufficient consolidation of political parties and inconsistent coalitional leadership, external factors like the global economic crisis and the policies of supranational organisations (EU, ECB) have had an even greater effect on the efficiency and duration of Slovenian coalitions from 2008 on. The article shows how the coalitional processes became interrelated in this period, and the importance of certain critical events. Confirmation is given of the preliminary hypothesis that the experiences of previous relatively stable governments and regular elections have not contributed to the stability of subsequent coalitional governments since 2008. Further, the experiences of previous withdrawals from governments have not reduced the possibility of future withdrawals."

A quarter of its articles are substantively related to Germany or pursue an approach specific of German IR, whereas three quarters are about international relations or EU studies more in general. Only papers written in German were accepted for the last annual German IR convention. This practice may have the unintended consequence of making German native speakers working abroad lose touch with their German colleagues. Given that ZIB often falls short of its target of publishing three articles per issue, the review process should be made more accommodating. Under any circumstance, peer review remains the hallmark of ZIB."
Has Terrorism Become more Brutalized since 9/11?,"Jäckle, Sebastian; Baumann, Marcel M.",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,"TERRORISM; SEPTEMBER 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001; CRUELTY",brutalization; empirical analysis; new terrorism; suicide attack; weak target,"In this article we test whether terrorism has become more brutal since the 1990s and especially since the attacks of 9/11. Building on a literature review, we examine the thesis of brutalization within the framework of the so called »new terrorism « and test it in an empirical and analytical way. We operationalize the brutalization of terrorism in eight different ways and examine these indicators over time from 1970 to 2011 on a worldwide scale as well as for different regions using data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). We show that there is only little empirical evidence for a general brutalization of terrorism taking place all around the globe since the early 1990s. Yet, particularly in the years after 9/11, a rising brutality could be observed in certain regions. This should nevertheless not be regarded as an indication for a novel kind of terrorism as the data shows that the level of brutality of this »new terrorism« is ultimately the same as in earlier phases."

The purpose of this article is to point out these differences in terms of health, well-being and life satisfaction. The present analysis is based on the SHARE Wave4 international study (2011). We analysed 1,306 Slovenian older people in terms of bivariate analysis. We found that self-perceived health was associated with age (p = 0.000). The oldest old have several health conditions (p = 0.000), difficulties concentrating (p = 0.000), are lacking energy (p = 0.001) and are more limited in daily and instrumental activities (p = 0.000). A positive attitude to life declines with age."

The authors seek to answer the question of whether the same types of institutional solutions give rise to the same patterns of government coalition formation, the same characteristics of governments or governmental coalitions and their duration. It is obvious that in the cases of Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the same type of electoral institutions produced certain similar consequences; however, there were more differences than similarities. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that similar institutional solutions do not automatically lead to the same patterns of government coalition formation, the same characteristics of governments/governmental coalitions and their duration."
How do countries respond to anti‐dumping filings? Dispute settlement and retaliatory anti‐dumping.,"Feinberg, Robert M.; Reynolds, Kara M.",World Economy,0,DUMPING (International trade); EMPIRICAL research; DISPUTE resolution (Law); WORLD Trade Organization; LEX talionis,antidumping; dispute settlement; retaliation,"Abstract: Empirical studies have found that countries may respond strategically to the anti‐dumping petition filed against their exporters through their own retaliatory actions. Although most previous studies have focused on retaliatory anti‐dumping filings, in this paper we explore another potential avenue for strategic response—filing a complaint under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) dispute settlement understanding. Using a panel of global anti‐dumping filings between 1995 and 2011, we analyse under what conditions countries will choose to retaliate through either an anti‐dumping petition or a WTO dispute, and to what degree these two strategies are complementary or act as substitutes. We find statistical evidence that countries are more likely to file a WTO dispute when they have also filed a retaliatory anti‐dumping petition, suggesting that these two strategies may be complementary."

In this context, the UN positioned itself as one of the most influential international actors, above all through its peace missions. However, in many cases these missions have not been successful, leading many scholars to question the work of the organization. The case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is a clear example of the failure of humanitarian intervention; despite the 14-year presence of the UN, the country remains at the top of the ranking of failed states."

Then it moves on to examine the role of ideas and identity with a view to analyze how this determines and constrains decision making, and to study how this role conditions regional identity. Finally, consideration is given to collective identity in relation to Mercosur."

USA aims to effectuate its Afghanistan focused regional interests and is trying to eliminate the instability in the region since 200!. However, there are lots of obstacles about the region that USA must overcome. Firstly, Taliban keeps the major part of Afghanistan under its control and also. Taliban has strengthened its influence over Pakistan. On the other hand. US strategic and economic targets, which USA is trying to reach by settling in Afghanistan, conflict with the targets of Russia and China. In this context, Iran and Pakistan, with their potential to affect all those conflicting targets and the stability in Afghanistan, stand in the forefront. \n this region, the ""national interest enclosed"" policies, that are able to change and conflict, have negative influence on US struggle against Taliban in Afghanistan. \n this study it has been sustained that above mentioned subjects or difficulties may be able to cause USA to fail in the region."
In search of spatial interdependence of US outbound FDI in the MENA region.,"Siddiqui, Anjum; Iqbal, Asim",World Economy,0,INTERNATIONAL business enterprises; INFLATION (Finance); BUREAUCRACY; WORLD Bank. Middle East & North Africa Region; INVESTMENTS,FDI; governance; infrastructure; resource endowments; spatial interdependence,"Abstract: The paper investigates the spatial interdependence of US MNE investments in the MENA region. Given the variations in resource endowments, governance structures and degree of infrastructure availability in MENA countries, one would expect these variables to affect an MNE's choice of FDI location. We do find that domestic non‐spatial factors such as own country inflation and governance measured by bureaucratic quality as well as infrastructure affect a host country's inward FDI. We also found that only one measure of natural resource endowment; that is, oil and gas exports were instrumental in attracting FDI. This non‐spatial result is generally robust and invariant to the two methodologies employed in this study, that is the spatially autoregressive (SAR) model and the spatial Durbin model (SDM). We found that neighbouring countries’ infrastructure availability measured either by “electricity used” or “energy used” affected FDI inflows in a host country. However, this spatial impact was found only in the SDM model. The spatial effects of neighbouring countries’ economic and political conditions and resource endowments were, however, not observed on a host country's inward FDI. The insignificance of both the surrounding market potential and the spatially weighted FDI suggests a purely horizontal motive of MNE investments in the MENA region."

The rapprochement with the Chilean government had a political goal, intended to shore up the domestic regime, which was then undergoing a social and political crisis. However, this rapprochement was only made possible because both the project of Chilean socialism and the radical change in Mexican foreign policy benefited from a favorable international context. This was characterized by a detente between the great powers, as well as by a strengthening of the international position of the Third-World countries in Latin America."
INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM IN THE USA AND IN SLOVENIA: CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL ASPECTS.,"MALEŠIČ, Marjan",Teorija in Praksa,1,EMERGENCY management; SLOVENIA; INCIDENT command systems; UNITED States,function; Incident Command System; incident commander; recent disasters in the USA and Slovenia; structure,"Since the mid 1970s, the USA has developed the Incident Command System (ICS) to improve coordination among the various actors involved in disaster response. The ICS establishes a temporary hierarchical structure, with the Incident Commander (or Unified Command) at the head of the intervention being responsible for co-ordinating and directing activities in the fields of operations, planning, logistics, administration and finances. The ICS is universal and its use is mandatory in all crises, applying to all actors that deal with such crises. The empirical evidence shows the ICS operates relatively well with small or routine disasters, whereas problems grow as the complexity of a disaster increases and ever more actors respond to it, often making improvisation necessary. A comparison of the original American model and the Slovenian practice seen in recent responses to disasters reveals that, functionally, the Slovenian experiences are very close to the American model, whereas the structural similarity is only partial, although analogous solutions in this field were lately developed by the Fire Fighters' Organisation, the Administration for Civil Protection, and individual municipalities."

Intensive and extensive margins of exports: What can India learn from China?,"Veeramani, Choorikkad; Aerath, Lakshmi; Gupta, Prachi",World Economy,0,EXPORTS; INTERNATIONAL trade; FOREIGN exchange rates; HIGH-income countries; GRAVITY model (Social sciences),China; India; Margins of exports,"Abstract: We decompose India's export performance in manufactured products during 2000–15 into changes at the intensive and extensive margins. India's performance, along different margins, is compared and contrasted with that of China. The results show that while China outperforms India at both the margins, the gap is particularly wide at the intensive margin. Decomposition of intensive margin along quantity and price margins shows that Chinese products are generally sold cheaper than Indian products. Higher price margin, however, has not translated into high intensive margin for India due to its abysmally low quantity margin. We examine different explanations for China's superior performance relative to India, along different margins, using a gravity model. Our results suggest that China's exchange rate policy was not the prime reason for its export success. Neither do we find that FDI inflows were significant in explaining the export performance gap between them. The results show that China's export relationship bias towards high‐income partner countries holds the key in understanding its superior performance. This bias is a natural consequence of China's high degree of specialization in labor‐intensive activities. India, by contrast, due to an idiosyncratic pattern of specialisation, has failed to exploit its export potential in high income countries."

Countries have specific strategic political, economic or other goals which they wish to implement by allocating (and tying) development aid. These interests need to be defined on a long-term basis as improved possibilities for co-operation in areas where, through development aid, a more stable political environment and sustainable economic development is being created. Slovenia lists co-operation with the Western Balkans as its foreign policy priority along with its development co-operation focus.

Most studies focus on the issues of censorship versus cyber dissent. The international dimension of the Internet is often neglected. This reduction of the analysis of the Internet to the national context misconceives the fact that the cyberspace already plays a key role in foreign policy decision-making and international relations. In addition to traditional international relations, coordinated between national governments, a multitude of new processes of interaction has emerged. Via the Internet national interests groups can articulate their views and can directly address the people or governments of other states. Moreover, the digitalization of politics causes the international security situation to change: New fields of conflict in international politics which have become visible in the cyber context (cyberattacks; cyber espionage) require new forms of global constitutionalization and a deepening of existing dialogue mechanisms."

For that we study two cases in particular, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) showing that opportunity structures are crucial for generating the interpretative authority of international administrations. However, local actors also could use those structures to articulate alternative concepts of the postwar political order and thereby contest the administration's authority. Effectively in the course of both state building missions this is the case."

By considering three types of social transformation - related to globalisation processes and relevant to the protection of human rights - the article argues for the plurality and co-existence of different theoretical approaches to human rights. The latter would make the ontology of human rights theory correspond better to the contemporary social reality and would make better use of the potential it carries."

Unique in some respects, Kosovo's case is also similar to many other political conflicts within multinational states related to ethnic, cultural and religious divides. De facto separated from Serbia by a NATO ""humanitarian intervention"" in 1999, in 2008 Kosovo became an example of a successful ""remedial secession"", arguably concluding Yugoslavia's dissolution into seven independent states. Yet Kosovo's declaration of independence divided the international community as well as EU and NATO members. The ICJ's advisory opinion, although favourable to Kosovo's cause, did not legalise all secessions. In order to solidify peace and stability in the Western Balkans, the international community will for quite some time have to remain attentive to and actively involved in assisting this youngest European state and in helping Kosovo and Serbia normalise their relations."

Sin embargo, esa apreciación no significa que la democracia se profundice dadas las resistencias de múltiples prácticas informales como el clientelismo, el corporativismo, la corrupción y la falta de un real Estado de Derecho."

L'article se demande si cela serait possible malgré la maturité des institutions politiques (électorales, chargées d'assurer la compétition et la participation, concernant les rapports entre les pouvoirs et entre la fédération et les états). Notre conclusion est qu'un retour au passé semble improbable. Cela ne veut pas dire que la consolidation de la démocratie sera facile, en raison de la persistance de pratiques informelles comme le clientélisme, le corporatisme ou la corruption, et aussi parce qu'il manque toujours un véritable Etat de droit."
La exportación de hidrocarburo y la inseguridad alimentaria en una economía pequeña y rica en petróleo.,"Hosein, Roger; Gookool, Rebecca",Social & Economic Studies,0,FOOD security,,"La Desagriculturalización se refiere al declinar prematuro del sector agrícola. En el caso de la economía de Trinidad y Tobago, el declinar en la dimensión y contribución del sector agricola puede ser atribuido al Mal Holandés. El dedinar en la agricultura tiene efectos significativamente negativos en la posición de seguridad alimentaria de la economía. Las variables principales que se asocian con la seguridad alimentaria son la Accesibilidad, Disponibilidad, Estabilidad y Utilización. En este trabajo se muestra que la economía de Trinidad y Tobago no asegura la alimentación y, dentro del contexto del Mal Holandés, la revitalización y el desarrollo sustentable del sector agrícola son cruciales para asegurar la posición de seguridad alimentaria de la economía."

Among other things, we found that several forms of reference automatism from a reliable source (we learnt) have formed part of Slovenian news reporting for almost 150 years and that, in the last decade, two automatisms have mostly been used, i.e. according to our information and according to unofficial information . Surprisingly, the automatism rumour has it is very common as well."

"Leaders, Partisanship and Voting Behavior in Italy, 1990-2008.","Garzia, Diego; Viotti, Federico",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,VOTING; ITALY; POLITICAL party leadership,elections; leader effect; party identification; personalization of politics; voting,"Previous studies have portrayed the personalization of politics as a consequence of the changes in the electoral market and the resulting transformations at the party level. However, empirical research has not reached a consensus on whether this process has actually exerted an impact on citizens' voting calculus. Long-term feelings of partisan attachment appear still central in voters' behavior, whereas party leader evaluations seem to play only a marginal role. This paper tries to examine the electoral consequences of the personalization of politics employing an alternative approach. In particular, we hypothesize that leader evaluations have become the key determinants of partisan ties at the individual level. We focus on the Italian case, a prototype of personalized parliamentary democracy. In the empirical section, we examine the ways in which leaders have influenced Italian voters' behavior in the last two decades. The results show that the electoral effect of party leaders (once the mediating effect of partisanship is taken into account) has steadily increased during the period under analysis."

But the uses of techniques are only partially established and remain largely subject to the organizational and practical conditions of jounnalistic work."

The overhaul of power in post-Soviet territories during this period was characterized by a strong personalization of regional political power. Nijni Novgorod stands out as an example owing to its ambivalence — as reflected in the contrast between, on the one hand, the implementation of economic reforms in favor of free enterprise (which involved international organizations and foreign firms) and, on the other hand, the reinforcement of the regional executive as a result of the forceful implication of the governor at that time, Boris Nemtsov."

Norms research must remain »critical« - here we agree with the previous contributions in the ZIB. This, however, is only possible, if actors can speak for themselves before a normative judgement is made by the researcher. Based on the proposed critical-constructivist research frame, we suggest an inductive research strategy which follows the logic of a double hermeneutic. If this is carried out successfully, local actors receive agency and speak for themselves. Only then (norms) research is critical. This contribution empirically illustrates such a research strategy by reconstructing the »meaning-in-use« of the norms of »freedom« and »equality« on the basis of reactions to FEMEN protests in the WANA region."

The first part of the lecture discusses the very reasons for this work, its necessity, and its place in my opus thus far. The task of The Immanence of Truths is to elaborate the question of how somebody is incorporated into a truth-process, how this relates to the question of the subject and the very role of philosophy itself. The latter is not the process of truth in a similar manner as its four conditions, it does presuppose them, but not the other way around. A short sketch of the inner structure of The Immanence of Truths follows and the argument in favour of the transformation of the formal category of negation. The role of the paraconsistent logics in The Immanence of Truths is to conceptualize the process of truth. The aleatory, the contingent character of any event namely means that we have to insist that there is a cut and that the truth is in the position of an exception, but which, however, is not something untransmittable. Concerning the question of the transmission and the ineffable, I distance myself in relation to Plato's as well as to Bergson's treatment of this question. For me, the category of an exception is a dialectical category. It has to be thought on one hand as a negation, which is not a miracle of some sort, and on the other as something inner, immanent (perhaps that was aimed at by Lacan with the term 'extimacy'). The negation is namely an operator which simultaneously divides and includes, it is also part of the dialectical thought which includes the contingent and is therefore not deterministic. Everything that has been said so far has consequences for the functions of philosophy and concerns the question of the relationship between philosophy and life. Philosophy for me as a discipline departs from the conviction that there are truths. It is triple, being at the same time the diagnostics of an age, the construction of the concept of truth, and the existential experience of true life i.e. the immanent experiment of what is a true life, ""what is it to live"". This is signalled by the affect of true life and by the formula ""to live as an immortal"", which does not entail any kind of sacrifice or recompense."
Local self-government with interdependence under Vladimir Putin: From Leningrad's regional centralism to the social utility of ecology in Karelia.,,Revue d'Études Comparatives Est-Ouest,1,"LOCAL government; POLITICAL autonomy; RUSSIA; PUTIN, Vladimir Vladimirovich, 1952-",authorities; centralization; civil society; local democracy; local self-government,"The ideas of local autonomy and self-government in Russia have rural roots running back to the idealized farming community (obsina) and the first local political assembly (zemstvo) established at the end of the 19th century. Over the past two decades, following seventy years under the rule of an overcentralized state, the issue of local government has returned to national politics. We paradoxically observe a low level of financial and political autonomy for local governments but a high degree of involvement by social actors in local issues. Two case studies focusing on the Northwestern Federal District serve to analyze the behavior of regional administrations and the personal strategies of the social forces that are shaping local democracy in Russia. Although these practices involve power struggles and social as well as environmental issues, they draw attention to a revival of rural areas as a mediating factor in northwestern Russia."

The paper organises the G20's efforts under five themes: macroeconomic stimulus, fiscal consolidation, monetary policy, the global financial safety net and global imbalances. The G20 was initially successful in each of these areas, but this success was short‐lived. While the G20 met its goals on macroeconomic stimulus, it has been less successful in reducing deficits and debt. While it was successful in increasing its resources, the global financial safety net remains too small, too fragmented and institutional reform is incomplete. While the G20 succeeded in moving to more market‐determined exchange rates and avoiding competitive devaluations, it struggled to avoid negative spillovers. Despite years of effort, the G20 has made limited progress in reducing global imbalances. Current account imbalances are creeping back to pre‐crisis levels. Public debt remains high and most economies are moving in the wrong direction in correcting imbalances in household savings and debt. The paper concludes that the G20 has done better in some areas than others. But to suggest the G20 is a forum in decline ignores its shift from reactive crisis response to longer‐term structural challenges outside of the pressing need of an immediate crisis."

W. F. Hegel; Immanuel Kant; Karl Marx; Social Norms,"This paper challenges the contemporary Marx scholarship's emphasis on questioning whether Marx's critique of capitalism should be understood in normative terms. The emphasis on the normativity of Marx's critique of the capitalist system has obscured Marx's normative understanding of that system. Marx understands the material structures constitutive of the capitalist organization of society as based on implicit social norms that are dependent on subjects' recognition of them—norms that only assume a material form as a result of such recognition but that cannot be unrecognized without material transformation. Marx inherits this rational sense of norms and their bindingness from Kant and Hegel, a sense that consists in the explanation of intentional states in terms of normative statuses and of normative statuses in terms of normative attitudes."

The positions taken by Mexico on the issues of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and Iran's nuclear program were in line with those assumed in the past. The factor bearing the greatest weight on these sensitive political issues is Mexico's close relationship with the United States, filtered through the preferences, interests and prejudices of the President and decision-makers in Mexico and Washington."

Analysis of these cases casts light on the potential and limitations of Mexico's foreign policy.

In Mexico's foreign policy a self-ascription as an emerging middle power was evident (although this concept does not appear in official documents), which in Africa translated into the deployment of a large number of activities. However, it is likely that these are short-term in nature. Moreover, with regard to the foreign policy objective of supporting internal development, not enough evidence was found to support this assumption."

Unilateral reduction of tariffs led to greater opening up of the country's economy; measures to boost trade were implemented and major trade disputes were resolved. By contrast, the agenda of trade negotiations made little progress and suffered setbacks. Despite the continuity in policy, business leaders and legislators both sought to overturn trade policy decisions that, however, led to a lack of trade integration. At a domestic level, unilateral liberalization made it easier to import commodities but did not lead to the formation of supply chains. At an external level, economic integration made little progress in creating better conditions for Mexican exports."

However, once the accession became certain, these monetary policies increased moral hazard and led to a surge in private debt in Bulgaria and public debt in Romania."
"More Creativity, Please.","Berenskötter, Felix",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,CREATIVE ability; PERIODICAL articles,creativity; german ir; innovation; ir theory; pluralism,"This contribution takes up the journal's mission to showcase foundational theoretical research by and for German scholars of International Relations (IR) and, thereby, to function as an expression of the »identity« of the German IR community. My impression is that, overall, German IR is less theoretically innovative and pluralistic than it claims to, and could be. This is largely due to the dominance of research clusters occupied with international regimes and »global governance«, a constraining concern with methods, and a somewhat distorted comparison with an »American « IR discourse. At the same time, I note that a closer look at articles published in this journal over the past decade shows some promising openings. Given the challenge to conceptually grasp the complex and changing field we call IR, I support these moves with a call for more intellectual courage and theoretical creativity."

It takes the predictions of models of firm heterogeneity and FDI activity as a reference to explore the characteristics of multinational firms from 30 European countries. We use a data set, based on ORBIS, which links information of parent–affiliate pairs of firms. Our results show that more productive firms have greater multinational activity in terms of both scope, the number of foreign markets where they invest, and scale, the volume of local sales by subsidiaries active in foreign markets. The estimation of gravity equations shows that country characteristics that encourage multinational activity successively induce the entry of less productive parent firms. We confirm this asymmetry for the GDPs of the home and host countries, distance, contiguity and other standard gravity equation variables."

The article identifies three biases in existing research: a focus on unambiguous solutions, the juxtaposition of legal and political solutions, and a focus on formalized orders. Based on this review, a typology of strategies for the solution of conflicts arising from overlap is presented, distinguishing between the toleration of ambivalence, case-by-case decisions, and the intentional creation of unambiguity. The latter can be created by the reordering of structures, hierarchization, or harmonization. In conclusion we discuss research perspectives regarding the descriptive, causal, and normative analysis of conflicts between normative orders."

NEOLIBERALISM AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS IN THE CITY.,"Ploštajner, Klemen",Teorija in Praksa,1,NEOLIBERALISM; CITIES & towns,city; neoliberalism; production of subjects; regulation of the economy; urbanism,"The main aim of the article is to concretise analyses of neoliberalism by theorising its spatial manifestations in the city. Neoliberalism is a special kind of state regulation which through use of market mechanisms of competition produces subjects that are subordinated to entrepreneurial logic. The logic of building and managing the city is thus also the subject of neoliberal demands manifested in accelerated gentrification, financialised construction, investments in mega-projects and administration of the city according to entrepreneurial logic. Construction in space is more and more perceived as an investment which must have a return in the form of tax income or increased consumption. The city, its construction and management are becoming an essential part of the reproduction of capitalism and neoliberal social relations."

"Nigerian Prostitution Racket in Turin and Genoa. Structures, Strategies and Transformations.","Cabras, Federica",Polis,1,PROSTITUTION; HUMAN trafficking; HUMAN trafficking victims,ju-ju rites; madame; Nigerian trafficking; sexual exploitation; Turin and Genoa,"For over twenty years Italy has represented the main European destination for trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nigerian women, deployed by a complex criminal system. The Nigerian criminal network is characterized by specific features, attributable to the particular social and cultural Nigerian context. This criminal system has an organizational structure that is unusual, as it is made up of women - ex victims of trafficking - in charge of supervising the exploitation of compatriot girls. The religious dimension - a particular mixture of pagan rites (ju-ju or voodoo) and Christian tradition (pentecostal congregation) - plays a fundamental role in the Nigerian racket. The religion is used as an effective instrument of coercion for the young women (ju-ju rites) and it also represents a moral support, able to give legitimacy to the criminal phenomenon of trafficking. The aim of this article is to analyze this complex criminal network in Turin and Genoa, as they represent the core area of Nigerian women exploitation in the Northeastern Italy. The fieldwork also aims to show the current modus operandi of the traffickers and it points out the racket differences and similarities within the two areas. The purpose of this research is to review the dichotomic categories like victim/butcher or exploited/exploiter and words like slavery and slave traffic, often used in the academic literature, but often unable to illustrate the complexity of the present system of coercion and exploitation."
"No illusions, no regrets: the current struggle to reform Ukraine.","Popovych, Maksym",European View,1,POLITICAL reform; ECONOMIC reform; UKRAINE -- Politics & government -- 1991-,,"This paper argues that positive changes in Ukraine in its economy, political system and public institutions depend on a clear escape from the Soviet legacy, which provokes political populism and stalls reforms. Despite the immense challenges of the Russian military intervention and the declining economy, Ukraine has made progress with its ambitious reform agenda. This paper discusses the achievements and setbacks in four policy areas: decentralisation, energy, the civil service and anti-corruption."
No More Their Own Affair. Organized Crime in the Rimini Area.,"Scalia, Vincenzo",Polis,1,MAFIA; ORGANIZED crime; MONEY laundering,expansion; Italy; organized crime; post-fordism; Rimini,"In late years, both public opinion and the scientific community have focused on the infiltration of organized crime in the socio-economic fabric of Northern Italy. Judicial enquiries have given evidence that the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the Neapolitan Camorra and the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta find it profitable to expand in the so-called non traditional areas, that is, in those areas where organized crime does not, traditionally, wield either an economic or a military control of the territory. This article focuses on the judicial enquiries named Vulcano and Mirror to sketch the patterns that criminal organizations follow to infiltrate the Rimini area, a part of Italy whose economy relies on tourism. Loansharking and laundering appear to be the main activities carried out by the Neapolitan Camorra. The mobsters show anyway a difference in the way they act, as far as the interaction with local economic actors is concerned. Moreover, the enquiries show how low the relationship between local politics and organized crime is at the moment."

Freud; self-deception,"The key issue of the contemporary discourse on self-deception is the necessity to explain the inner structure of consciousness or the state of mind which enable us to tell lies to ourselves or to be befooled by one's own tricks. Two different approaches to the problem are analyzed: Sartre's concept of bad faith as well as Davidson's concept of self-deception. What these divergent conceptions have in common is their intentional approach. However, Sartre's conception deriving from his ontological considerations (conceiving the consciousness in its unity) is seen as substantially different from Davidsonian rationalizing the phenomenon in question by claiming the division of mind. For Sartre a person of a bad faith is one disguising his or her freedom, i.e. the non-coincidence, which defines her or his being."
Odd or even? Equal Opportunities According to the Italian Councilwomen.,"Farina, Fatima; Carbone, Domenico",Polis,1,WOMEN in politics; GENDER mainstreaming; REPRESENTATIVE government,councilwomen; equal opportunity; gender mainstreaming; survey; women political participation,"This article aims to analyse the issue of equal opportunities within the relevant social context of political representation at the local level in Italy. The gap between the formal political rights enjoyment and the low participation in active political life, common to several Western democracies, is in Italy significantly wide, due to the high gender inequality. The number of women on the Italian political scene tends to increase inversely to the centrality of the institutions, from the national to the local level. The focus of the paper is on the configuration of women representation at the local level through the findings of a survey based on CAWI method on a national sample of Italian councilwomen. The article consists of four parts. The first deals with women participation in representative political institutions. The second part describes the research process. The third part illustrates the analysis of the main survey results. In the conclusions, we discuss the findings and reflect on women political action and on how the issue of gender equality advocates or not their institutional role, by considering current literature and public debate."

On Double Identities.,,Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,INTERNATIONAL relations -- Study & teaching; INTERNATIONAL relations; GERMANY; RESEARCH; SCHOLARLY publishing,german ir; internationalization; professionalization; publication strategies; theory and practice,This contribution starts with the diagnosis of a successful internationalization of German IR and a resulting concentration on publishing in English. It argues that this generally laudable development also has unwanted side-effects for the German-speaking IR community and that for reasons of both individual as well as collective rationality there might be reasons for not concentrating solely on the English-speaking market. It thus makes an appeal to also publish in German and if possible also publish with a view of the interests of a more general public.
ON THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM OF WILL IN ERNST TUGENDHAT.,"MURÁNSKY, MARTIN",Filozofia,1,"FREE will & determinism; TUGENDHAT, Ernst",affectivity; causality; determinism; freedom of action; freedom of will; intentionality,"The present analysis of the evolution of the concept of freedom in Ernst Tugendhat's philosophy aims to highlight several interesting facts. First, Tugendhat attempts to describe the meaning of Kant's statement ""I could have acted otherwise"" from a nontranscendental perspective. Second, he makes an effort to avoid the classical Kantian dilemma of the relation of free will and determinism by posing the question differently. Third, he situates the issue of the relation of freedom and causality in the framework of the inner structure of freedom - examining it from the perspective of the human's relation to him- or herself. Fourth, he attempts repeatedly to overcome the impossibility of considering freedom in the objective language of causality. The paper demonstrates why the issue of freedom remains a central problem of continental philosophy."

On Why Mexicans Join and Participate in Non-Governmental Organizations.,"SOMUANO, FERNANDA",Foro Internacional,1,NONGOVERNMENTAL organizations; MEXICO; SOCIAL participation,associationism; civil organization; civil society; Mexico; political participation,"Mexico is not noted for its highly politically-active citizens. With the exception of the vote, other activities common in established democracies, such as contacting a political representative, attending a local council meeting, signing a petition or participating in a non-governmental organization, are unusual activities for Mexicans. This article considers what leads an individual to decide to join and become involved in a non-governmental organization in Mexico; what leads people to channel their demands using this type of organization rather than through interest groups, social movements, political parties or businesses; and how to encourage participation and citizen organization in a democracy such as that of Mexico?"

We take our response to our critics, firstly, as an opportunity to clarify some of the arguments made in our article. Secondly, we confront the points of criticism outlined above and show that Deitelhoff's and Zimmermann's critique can only be maintained if one accepts their particular reading of our article. Moreover, it gets tangled up in three major contradictions and is built upon a problematic understanding of the relation between empirical facticity and normative evaluation."

Utilizing data from a survey experiment, we study the effects of different frames on mass attitudes towards a potential military mission to Libya in 2011. We show that in this case stressing the risks and dangers of military combat does not significantly lower mission support. Reminding citizens of the humanitarian goals of the deployment, however, substantively boosts public support. Citizens who prefer an active German foreign policy and left-leaning citizens are influenced most strongly by the humanitarian frame."

The system that governs the State-worker relationship, a legacy of Mexico's authoritarian past, helps to explain the calculations made by labor union leaders and government officials regarding the country's democratic transition. This document analyzes changes to political representation in labor unions and the electoral behavior of unionized workers, together with the successive failures experienced by the proposed reform to the Federal Working Law since 2000 and the implications for the workers' movement and Mexican society."

The EU has chosen the way of harmonizing national legislation through activation of police and judicial cooperation whereby it has tried to contribute the integration. On the other hand, the EU is on the way of increasing its transatlantic ties. However, cooperation in fight against global terror and measures led to make the EU find itself in a dilemma as well as causing change in security perception. The required balance in between security need and civil liberties, particularly in terms of transatlantic cooperation, became the one of the most debatable issues in the EU. This study deals with the dilemma which the EU has experienced for in terms of counter-terrorism policies and with the balance between security and civil liberties, through the sample of PNR Case."

Political science for what? Giovanni Sartori's scholarly answer.,"Pasquino, Gianfranco",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,"POLITICAL systems; POLITICAL science; SARTORI, Giovanni, 1924-2017",Constitutional engineering; Democracy; Giovanni Sartori; Political science,"There are different conceptions of political science. Several scholars stress the word «science» and some of them accurately avoid any «political» implications of their work. Many other scholars prefer to underline the importance of the adjective «political». They recognize the implications of their research and writings for the functioning of the parties, the institutions, the political systems. They go even further, that is, they suggest how the knowledge acquired by political science could be put to good use. Giovanni Sartori's contributions are addressed, more or less explicitly, into the second direction. Sartori has no doubt: political science is a science that can be applied. His answer to the question «knowledge for what?» is loud and clear. Political science knowledge can improve the functioning of democratic political systems, of political parties, of the institutional circuit «voters-Parliament-government», and can assess the likely consequences of different types of electoral systems. Both in his scholarly production and in his frequent contributions to the Italian debate on institutional reforms, Sartori has shown how his political science provides truly useful knowledge. This paper will explore, analyze, and evaluate Sartori's teachings and writings in the field of political and constitutional engineering."
Politics as usual!,,Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,"DECISION making; EUROPEAN Sovereign Debt Crisis, 2009-",euro crisis; european union; institutionalism; joint-decision making; regulation,"The EU's reaction to the dramatic Euro crisis follows a normal institutional pathway which has already been pursued in earlier crises of integration. The EU is characterized by jointdecision-making which does not only prevent crisis management by integration but also crisis management by desintegration. Thus, the EU has to rely on conflict-preventing incremental decision-making strategies. Disagreements in monetary policy since Maastricht have been circumvented by incomplete contracts which led to massive follow-up problems during the Euro crisis. Faced with critical publics in many member states, the EU reacts with further conflictpreventing decision-strategies such as the limited creation of fiscal capacity and a strong preference for regulation. As in earlier crises, the EU emphasizes incremental integration in order to mitigate pressing crisis symptoms and to reassure critical publics. However, these strategies do not solve the causes of the crisis but only further process the crisis in institutionally acceptable pathways."
POP YOUTH.

He then discusses the difference between cultural studies of youth in Great Britain after the Second World War and research of youth in the context of socialism as well as in the context of political democracy in Slovenia. During socialism, the hegemonic approach to social science was class analysis and, as a result, youth was perceived as an ideological construct. There was no interest in research into youth lifestyles. The first research of youth subcultures was only carried out in the 1990s. In the concluding discussion, the author explains this research lag with the underdeveloped cultural industry, the smallness of the Slovenian cultural space and the conservatism of its cultural milieu."

The authors state that in the European legal arena it is allowed to demand that a journalist reveal a secret source only exceptionally, when there is intense public interest, and they suggest changes in the Slovenian legislation. Analysis of the relevant legal documents and case law is combined with the method of semi structured interviews with 15 journalists. The interviewees have different views on whether revealing a confidential source is admissible; the prevalent one is that the promise of confidentiality should be respected unless the circumstances are exceptional."

The meanings and the different readings of these two themes of the democratic modernity provide by themselves an accurate image of the period in question. For Central and South-eastern Europe, these two indicators burst into the political scenery and in the political thought at the same period, under the significant impact of the French Revolution. This article is tracking the main paradigm changes produced in the political thought in this part of Europe, especially in the Romanian Principalities, interpreted trough the lenses of civic aggregation and the creation of civil society. Individuals are more and more defined as holding a double existence, as public markers and private entities; this fresh perspective accompanies the expression of either tolerance (accompanied by an auto-critical perspective) or antagonism (of class, race, religion, civilization in a more general matter of speaking) and they are at the ground foundation of modern political system."

The Internet has not succeeded in bringing into play the fundamental normative feature of public media - the conversion of particularistic interests into a common interest by confronting the rulers and the ruled, and mediating between them - not because of its technological nature, but because of its social nature. More than new interpretations of the (transnational) public sphere and public opinion, efforts are needed to change them in a direction that would enable the manifestation of publicity in its original 'three-dimensional design' as a personal right to communicate in public, surveillance of the public over government (governance), and mediation between the state and civil society."
Quality beyond the SSCI.,,Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,SCHOLARLY periodicals -- Ratings & rankings,global governance; international organziations; ir journals; professionalization; ssci,"It has become common practice to draw on the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) to assess the quality of political science journals. While this seems to be adequate for journals published in English, it appears to be inappropriate with regard to non-English journals such as the German-language Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB). For this reason our assessment of the quality of the ZIB draws on two alternative criteria: we analyze on the one hand whether the ZIB has developed its own substantive profile, i.e. a thematic core which coincides with theoretical and methodological pluralism; and we analyze on the other hand ZIB's academic relevance, i.e. whether it is used for publication and cited by a heterogenous community of relevant IR scholars. The ZIB fares pretty well against both criteria, thus testifying the high quality standards it has reached in the two decades of its existence. ZIB publications seem to be key for academic careers in German IR, perhaps more so than some publications in English speaking SSCI-listed journals."

But our analysis of three countries [Britain, Uzbekistan and Egypt] has shown that these factors alone cannot explain why HT is influential in some countries but not in some others where these disadvantages as far as the Muslim youth are concerned also exist. Our comparative analysis of the three cases suggests that theological deprivation is the major factor that paves the way for radicalization of the Muslim youth when socio-economic and political deprivations already exist."
Rational and Constructivist Approaches to the Study of International Political Economy.,"Moschella, Manuela",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,INTERNATIONAL economic relations; RATIONALISM,American school; British school; constructivism; international political economy; rationalism,"The paper compares the rational and the constructivist approach to the study of international political economy (Ipe). In doing so, the paper focuses on the ontological and epistemological features that allow distinguishing between the two approaches. This distinction is further itemized in the illustration of the two main, contemporary Ipe schools: the American and the British school. The article concludes by reflecting on the modalities through which recent studies have attempted to reconcile the rational and the constructivist approach."
Rebellion and Government: Elite Strategies of Legitimation in Kosovo.,"Hensell, Stephan",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,POLITICAL communication; WAR; KOSOVO (Republic),elites; framing; Kosovo; legitimation; rebels,"The transformation of rebel groups into political elites after war marks a transition from armed resistance to political domination. These political positions, however, need to be legitimated. The article discusses strategies of legitimation of the new political elites in Kosovo, who emphasize their governance competencies and the integration in international institutions in international arenas while emphasizing the myth of war and the commemoration of the resistance in local arenas. The results are strategic acts of communication, which differ according to the addressee. The case of Kosovo illustrates that both audiences are separable and that the postwar remembrance of the armed resistance plays a central role for the legitimation of the actors."
Rebels With a Cause - But Which One? Defections from Legislative Party Unity in Italy and Their Individual and Institutional Determinants.,"Curini, Luigi; Marangoni, Francesco; Tronconi, Filippo",Rivista Italiana di Scienza Politica,1,LEGISLATIVE voting; POLITICAL parties; ITALY,electoral rules; fractional logit; Italian political system; party unity; roll call,"The topic of legislative party unity has received growing attention from scholars of comparative politics in recent years; however, the study of legislative party unity in the Italian context has been by and large excluded from most of the literature. The purpose of this article is to fill this gap by shedding light on the magnitude of the phenomenon of legislative voting defections and offering some possible explanations for these defections. Drawing on an original dataset spanning over three legislative terms (13th, 14th, and 15th), the results of this study suggest that the traditional image of Italian politics dominated by strong party organisations overwhelming the individual components of representation is to a large extent still valid, at least in the field of legislative voting. This does not mean that parties are able to perfectly control the parliamentary activity of their members. On the contrary, defections from the official party line are present in Italy as in other parliamentary democracies and here too they are driven by the structure of opportunities in which elected representatives operate. In particular, we show that individual characteristics have no discernable impact on legislative voting, while party reputation, inclusion in government coalitions, and the electoral system are all relevant factors in explaining the propensity of MPs to break party discipline."

"Religious Revival among the Zhuang People in China: Practising ""Superstition"" and Standardizing a Zhuang Religion.","Ya-ning, KAO",Journal of Current Chinese Affairs,1,STANDARDIZATION; CHINA; REVIVALS (Religion); ZHUANG (Chinese people); SCHOLARS; SUPERSTITION,"""superstition""; Buluotuo; China; Nong Zhigao; religious revival; Zhuang people","This paper examines two cases of Zhuang religious revival involving multiple actors. It shows how consideration of ""superstition"" ( mixin) places some religious practice outside the institutional framework when discussing the modern concept of religion in China. In this paper, I particularly focus on two main dimensions of religious revival among the Zhuang people. The first is a grassroots dimension that involves the revival of a so-called ""superstitious"" cult in which Zhuang people along the Sino-Vietnamese border carry out shamanic rituals to make offerings to a powerful chief-turned-deity, Nong Zhigao, and his wife. The second dimension is a top-down dynamic and involves a series of projects conducted by Zhuang officials, scholars and business persons, which aim to standardize a Zhuang religion, known as Mo religion. These two cases of religious revival demonstrate the varied strategies utilized by different actors in response to government policies regarding religion in China."
Remembering the Orly Attack.,"GAUIN, Maxime",Review of International Law & Politics,0,TERRORISM; AEROPORT d'Orly; FRANCE,ARF; Armenian Terrorism; ASALA; Hunchak; JCAG; Orly; Ramkavar,"The bombing of Orly Airport, on July 15, 1983, one the two bloodiest attacks by Armenian terrorists in the 1970s and 1980s, is not an accident or a crime whose responsibility could be attributed only to a tiny group of extremists. It is rather a logical consequence of a decade of violence. If the trial of 1985 was a great victory against the terrorism, the ""recognition"" of the ""Armenian genocide"" claims in the French Parliament, against the dispositions of the French Constitution, was a reward to terrorism, and decisive in securing the release of the main perpetrator of the Orly bombing."

Resistance and Domination in World Society: Introduction.,"Beck, Teresa Koloma; Veit, Alex",Zeitschrift für Internationale Beziehungen (ZIB),1,INTERNATIONAL relations; GLOBALIZATION; RESISTANCE to government,contentious politics; domination; globalization; resistance; violence,"As a thematic introduction of the forum, this paper develops a concept of resistance that makes the term fruitful for the study of International Relations (IR). We propose to consider resistance and domination not as distinct phenomena, but as a complex. The empirical observation of resistance is the starting point for research on resistance and domination alike. Such a change of perspective seems useful because it allows the empirical analysis of structures of domination under the conditions of globalization. The latter are not simply evident, but become visible and accessible at the moment of their oppositional questioning. However, we reduce the analytical significance of resistance not to a source of information about rule. Rather, we emphasize its productive effect: Resistance allows new analytical perspectives on global power structures while, at the same time, reproducing them empirically."
